/**
 * The VM is configured to automatically run this object (which basically functions as a singleton class),
 * and to call the functions corresponding to each mode, as described in the TimedRobot documentation.
 * This is written as an object rather than a class since there should only ever be a single instance, and
 * it cannot take any constructor arguments. This makes it a natural fit to be an object in Kotlin.
 *
 * If you change the name of this object or its package after creating this project, you must also update
 * the `Main.kt` file in the project. (If you use the IDE's Rename or Move refactorings when renaming the
 * object or package, it will get changed everywhere.)
