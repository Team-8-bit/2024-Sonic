/**
 * Main initialization function. Do not perform any initialization here
 * other than calling `RobotBase.startRobot`. Do not modify this file
 * except to change the object passed to the `startRobot` call.
 *
 * If you change the package of this file, you must also update the
 * `ROBOT_MAIN_CLASS` variable in the gradle build file. Note that
 * this file has a `@file:JvmName` annotation so that its compiled
 * Java class name is "Main" rather than "MainKt". This is to prevent
 * any issues/confusion if this file is ever replaced with a Java class.
 *
 * If you change your main Robot object (name), change the parameter of the
 * `RobotBase.startRobot` call to the new name. (If you use the IDE's Rename
 * Refactoring when renaming the object, it will get changed everywhere
 * including here.)
